            I recently graduated with distinction from The British Columbia Institute of Technology in the Computer Systems Technology Bachelor of Technology (Network Security Administration Option). Following my graduation I moved to Orange County, California and am currently awaiting work authorisation.

            Completing my Degree, I became a strong software developer on desktop, mobile and web platforms. I have written and implemented applications which leverage raw sockets on Linux as well as Libpcap in various capacities. I have gained the ability to write firewalls which I used as part of my volunteer experience as a member of the steering committee for CUCSC developing our production website. I have created honeypot servers and analysed their traffic. I have learned assembly and used that knowledge to perform malware analysis. I have written simple malware programs to be used in simulated environments, and have leveraged the sophisticated tools in Kali Linux.

            As part of the Diploma program, I focused on data communication and internetworking. As part of this program I had experience doing system programming on both Linux and Windows, I had experience developing several GPS projects on Android and Linux. I implemented software solutions utilizing various PHP frameworks. Using Zend I worked with representatives from Hootsuite to complete a project which we dubbed “Night Owl” for managing feature flags.

        Through both programs and continuing after I had the opportunity to work with and develop skills in several programming languages and libraries including: C, C++, Golang, PHP, Javascript, CSS3, HTML5, Java, Android, Python, Ruby and Assembly.
        </p>
        <p>
        I strongly believe that my experience has prepared me well for any challenge I may face in a technical position. I am hard working and a fast learner, and have a passion for computers and technology.
